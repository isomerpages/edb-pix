_Just a quick note – we refer to several independent resources available on the internet targeted at people relocating to Singapore as part of this guide to ease your search for information. However, we do not endorse or promote any content in particular, and kindly ask you to exercise discretion when referring to these resources.

### Find Housing in Singapore

Most expatriates would consider renting when first relocating to Singapore. You may wish to explore property portals such as [PropertyGuru](https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/) or [99.co](https://www.99.co/) for rental options across different areas in Singapore.

You can also consider co-living or serviced residences, which may provide greater flexibility as they offer shorter lease periods. Dollars and Sense, a local personal finance website, [offers a comprehensive guide to co-living and serviced residences in Singapore](https://dollarsandsense.sg/price-guide-co-living-spaces-serviced-apartments/).

For more comprehensive information, read this [guide to Settling in Singapore](https://singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/guides/settling-in-sg/) by the Singapore Global Network which covers many other aspects of living and working in Singapore, beyond housing.

### Apply to enrol in Singapore’s Education System

Families relocating to Singapore can choose to enrol their children in either mainstream public schools or private international schools.
