## For all companies
-----------------

### 1. Register your business with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA)

**What is ACRA:** <br>Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) is the national regulator of business registration, financial reporting, public accountants, and corporate service providers.

**Why is this important:** <br>Every foreign business operating in Singapore needs to [choose a business structure](https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/registering-a-foreign-company) and register with ACRA.

**Things to** **note:** <br>It is a legal requirement for foreign companies to appoint a local resident director and submit his/her particulars to ACRA during the registration. However, foreigners not residing in Singapore are also allowed to act as directors in your company as long as there is a minimum of one local director.

**How to register:** <br>Unless you are a [foreigner with Entrepass](https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/foreigners-registering-a-business-in-singapore/submitting-your-application-via-bizfile), you must engage the services of a [registered filing agent](https://www.edb.gov.sg/connections-concierge/service-providers.html?tab=general-service-providers&amp;servicecategory=incorporation&amp;corporatesecretarialsolutions) (e.g. law firm, accounting firm or corporate secretarial firm) to submit the online application on your behalf.

**Processing time:** <br>14 days to 2 months, depending on whether the application needs to be referred to another agency for approval or review.

[Go to ACRA Website to find out more about registering your business](https://www.acra.gov.sg/)

[Go to EDB Connections Concierge to find a registered filing agent](https://www.edb.gov.sg/connections-concierge/service-providers.html?tab=general-service-providers&amp;servicecategory=incorporation&amp;corporatesecretarialsolutions)

### 2. Apply for a CPF Submission Number (CSN)

**What is CPF:** <br>
The Central Provident Fund (CPF) is a mandatory social security savings scheme for employees who are/become Singapore Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents. Find out more about the CPF and what employers need to do [here](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/employer/making-cpf-contributions).

**Why is this important:**<br>
 As an employer, you are required to pay CPF contributions for your employees who are Singapore Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents. To do so, you require a CPF Submission Number (CSN) to submit CPF contributions for your employees.

**Things to note:**<br>
Please apply for your CSN as soon as you intend to hire your first employee in Singapore.

**How to apply:** <br> 
For your convenience, you or the registered filing agent can apply for a CSN during the ACRA registration process itself in Step 1.

[Go to the CPF Website to find out more about CSN](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/employer/making-cpf-contributions/applying-for-a-cpf-submission-number)

### 3. Register for a Corppass Account

**What is Corppass:** A Corppass account is a secure digital identity for businesses and other entities to transact with the Singapore government online.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Why is this important:** The use of Corppass is mandatory for most government transactions such as filing tax returns, applying for work permits for foreign employees, and submitting regulatory filings.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Things to note:** Foreign registered entities (not yet registered with ACRA) may still appoint a foreigner employee based outside of Singapore to register for a Corppass Admin account. However, not all e-services are made available to Foreign ID Corppass users.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **How to apply:** For ease and convenience, many foreign companies choose to engage the help of [corporate secretarial services](https://www.edb.gov.sg/connections-concierge/service-providers.html?tab=general-service-providers&amp;servicecategory=incorporation&amp;corporatesecretarialsolutions) to manage the registration and setting up of a Corppass account. Alternatively, you may find out more about Corppass and registration [here](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/cpauth/login/homepage?URL=%2F&amp;TAM_OP=login).
