# For companies relocating foreign employees to Singapore

In addition to performing the key administrative steps detailed in the previous section, you are required to take note of the following requirements depending on the type of passes that your employees will be on.

### For Employment Pass and S Pass - Get access to myMOM Portal

**What is myMOM Portal:** <br>myMOM Portal allows business employers to centrally access eServices, workforce information and perform transactions on the Ministry of Manpower website with one login.

**Why is this important:** <br>Access to myMOM Portal is required to apply for Employment Pass and S Pass for your employees. It is also the portal to use to renew, issue, or cancel work passes for your employees.

**How to access myMOM Portal:**<br> You will need a Corppass account and have your [Corppass admin or sub-admin](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/corppass/common/userguides) [assign myMOMPortal to your Corppass account](https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/mymom-portal#what-do-i-need-before-i-can-use-mymom-portal). Once you have done so, you may login to myMOM Portal [here.](https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/mymom-portal)
