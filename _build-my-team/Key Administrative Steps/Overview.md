Ready to build your team? 

There are some key administrative steps that you need to take before hiring or relocating employees in Singapore.

#### For all companies
* Register your business with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA)
* Apply for a CPF Submission Number (CSN)
* Register for a Corppass Account

#### For companies relocating foreign employees to Singapore
In addition to the three steps above:

<u> For Employment Pass (EP) and S Pass</u>
<br>Get access to the myMOM Portal to apply for pass 

<u>For all other passes (ONE Pass, Personalised Employment Pass (PEP), EntrePass, and Tech.Pass)</u>
<br>Apply for pass directly via respective portals 






For companies relocating foreign employees to Singapore
-------------------------------------------------------

In addition to performing the key administrative steps detailed in the previous section, you are required to take note of the following additional requirements depending on the type of passes that your employees will be on

### For Employment Pass and S Pass - Get access to the myMOM Portal

路&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **What is myMOM Portal:** myMOM Portal allows business employers to centrally access eServices, workforce information and perform transactions on the Ministry of Manpower website with one login.

路&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Why is this important:** Access to myMOM Portal is required to apply for Employment Pass and S Pass for your employees. It is also the portal to use to renew, issue, or cancel work passes for your employees.

路&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Things to note:** To access myMOM Portal, you will need a Corppass account and [allow access of myMOMPortal to the company representative performing the application](https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/mymom-portal#what-do-i-need-before-i-can-use-mymom-portal).

路&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **How to apply:** You can apply for Employment Pass and S Pass via myMOM Portal [here](https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/mymom-portal)

### For all other passes (ONE Pass, Personalised Employment Pass, EntrePass and Tech.Pass)

Unlike Employment Pass or S Pass, individuals seeking to relocate to Singapore via ONE Pass, Personalised Employment Pass, EntrePass, or Tech.Pass can apply for these passes directly via the respective pass application systems.
