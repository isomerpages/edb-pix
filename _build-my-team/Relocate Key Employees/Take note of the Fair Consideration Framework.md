# Take note of the Fair Consideration Framework

The [Fair Consideration Framework (FCF)](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/fair-consideration-framework) sets out requirements for all employers in Singapore to consider the workforce in Singapore fairly for job opportunities. Employers should not discriminate on characteristics that are not related to the job, such as age, gender, nationality or race.

To promote fair employment practices and improve labour market transparency, employers submitting Employment Pass and S Pass applications must first advertise on [MyCareersFuture](https://www.mycareersfuture.gov.sg/) and fairly consider all candidates.

Find out more about the FCF job advertising requirements for [Employment Pass](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/employment-pass/consider-all-candidates-fairly) and [S Pass](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/s-pass/consider-all-candidates-fairly).

However, for practical reasons, your company may not be required to advertise roles on MyCareersFuture if you meet **any of the following requirements**:

* Your company has fewer than 10 employees.

* The fixed monthly salary for the vacancy is $20,000 and above. (Note: From 1 Sep 2023, the salary threshold for exemption from FCF job advertising requirement will be raised to $22,500. This is benchmarked to the top 10% of EP holders.)

* The role is short-term, i.e. not more than 1 month.

* The role is to be filled by a local transferee.

* \[for EP only\] The role is to be filled by a candidate choosing to apply as an [overseas intra-corporate transferee](https://www.mom.gov.sg/faq/fair-consideration-framework/can-a-job-be-exempted-from-the-advertising-requirement-if-it-will-be-filled-by-an-intra-corporate-transferee-ict).

To access a larger pool of candidates, employers in Singapore are strongly encouraged to advertise their job vacancies on MyCareersFuture, even if those jobs are eligible for advertising exemption.
