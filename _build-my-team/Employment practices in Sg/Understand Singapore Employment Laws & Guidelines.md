## Familiarise yourself with Singapore’s Employment Laws
-----------------------------------------------------

[The Employment Act](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/employment-act) is Singapore’s main labour law. It outlines the basic terms and working conditions for all types of employees. It includes guidelines on paid public holiday &amp; leave entitlements for employees, and process requirements for employers.

Foreign employees holding a work pass are also covered by the [Employment of Foreign Manpower Act](https://www.mom.gov.sg/legislation/employment-of-foreign-manpower-act), which outlines an employer’s responsibilities and obligations for employing foreigners.

## Read Guidelines for Fair Employment and Consideration
-----------------------------------------------------

Employers should take note of the [Fair Consideration Framework](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/fair-consideration-framework), which sets out requirements for all employers to consider the workforce in Singapore fairly for job opportunities.

Employers are also expected to adhere to the [Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices](https://www.tal.sg/tafep/resources/publications/2019/tripartite-guidelines-on-fair-employment-practices), which set out fair employment practices that should be adopted by employers.
