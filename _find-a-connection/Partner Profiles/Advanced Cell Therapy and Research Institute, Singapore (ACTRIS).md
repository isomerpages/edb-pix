### Advanced Cell Therapy and Research Institute, Singapore (ACTRIS)
#### Overview
<br>

|![](https://www.actris.sg/images/Logos/actris%20logo_transparent.png) | The Advanced Cell Therapy and Research Institute, Singapore (ACTRIS) was established in 2020 to be the national and regional centre of excellence for facilitating discovery, process development and manufacturing of cellular-based therapeutics. Its objectives are to promote and foster the entire value chain of the cellular therapy ecosystem through enabling translational research and development, manfacturing, clinical service provision and commercialisation by serviing the healthcare, academic and industrial sectors. ACTRIS also provides value-added services such as workforce training, regulatory facilitation and ancillary material standardisation pertaining to delivery of cellular therapy to patients. |

#### Ways to work with ACTRIS
##### 1. Technology Transfer
ACTRIS will perform all the manufacturing related activities and the client is just expected to source for project specific equipment and reagents. A key advantage of this model for clients is that through the service provisions and capabilities of ACTRIS, the novel or in-house CTGTPs will have an expedited route to clinical trials and potential commercialisation and/or clinical adoption.

**Who is this suitable for?** 
* Academic Institutions

##### 2. Facility Rental
The client will perform all key activities - such as bringing in necessary project-specific equipment and manpower to perform all other aspects of manufacturing, while ACTRIS provides the GMP rooms with basic equipment and training for the clients' employees to use the facility. A key advantage of this model for pharmaceutical companies is that it will allow them to initiate manufacturing activities on a small-scale through ACTRIS as they embark on developing their own commercial-scale facility within Singapore.

##### 3. Partnership
ACTRIS will provide GMP rooms and manpower training while the client will have to source for project specific equipment and reagents. A key advantage of this model for start-up/ biotechnology companies is that early investments will be used for product development to expedite clinical manufacturing and product pipeline expansion rather than channeling investment towards infrastructure building and operationalisation. Only after the novel CTGT products by these biotechnology companies have proven to be safe and efficacious in early phase trials will it then be de-risked and be more suited to be manufactured at an "owned" or outsourced commercial-scale facility to support multicentre trials or large-scale distribution network.
