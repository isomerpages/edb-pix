## Key administrative steps before hiring in Singapore


### 1. Register your business with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA)

**What is ACRA:** <br>Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) is the national regulator of business registration, financial reporting, public accountants, and corporate service providers.

**Why is this important:** <br>Every foreign business operating in Singapore needs to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/registering-a-foreign-company">choose a business structure</a> and register with ACRA.

**Things to** **note:** <br>It is a legal requirement for foreign companies to appoint a local resident director and submit his/her particulars during the ACRA registration. However, foreigners not residing in Singapore are also allowed to act as directors in your company as long as there is a minimum of one local director.

**How to register:** <br>Unless you are a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/foreigners-registering-a-business-in-singapore/submitting-your-application-via-bizfile">foreigner with Entrepass</a>, you must engage the services of a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.edb.gov.sg/connections-concierge/service-providers.html?tab=general-service-providers&amp;servicecategory=incorporation&amp;corporatesecretarialsolutions">registered filing agent</a> (e.g. law firm, accounting firm or corporate secretarial firm) to submit the online application on your behalf.

**Processing time:** <br>14 days to 2 months, depending on whether the application needs to be referred to another agency for approval or review.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.acra.gov.sg/">Go to ACRA Website to find out more about registering your business</a>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.edb.gov.sg/connections-concierge/service-providers.html?tab=general-service-providers&amp;servicecategory=incorporation&amp;corporatesecretarialsolutions">Go to EDB Connections Concierge to find a registered filing agent</a>

### 2. Apply for a CPF Submission Number (CSN)

**What is CPF:** <br>
The Central Provident Fund (CPF) is a mandatory social security savings scheme for employees who are/become Singapore Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents. Find out more about the CPF and what employers need to do <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/employer/making-cpf-contributions">here.</a>

**Why is this important:**<br>
 As an employer, you are required to pay CPF contributions for your employees who are Singapore Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents. To do so, you require a CPF Submission Number (CSN) to submit CPF contributions for your employees.

**Things to note:**<br>
Please apply for your CSN as soon as you intend to hire your first employee in Singapore.

**How to apply:** <br> 
For your convenience, you or the registered filing agent can apply for a CSN during the ACRA registration in Step 1.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/employer/making-cpf-contributions/applying-for-a-cpf-submission-number">Go to the CPF Website to find out more about CSN</a>

### 3. Register for a Corppass Account

**What is Corppass:** <br>A Corppass account is a secure digital identity for businesses and other entities to transact with the Singapore government online.

**Why is this important:** <br>The use of Corppass is mandatory for most government transactions such as filing tax returns, applying for work permits for foreign employees, and submitting regulatory filings.

**Things to note:** <br>Foreign registered entities (not yet registered with ACRA) may still appoint a foreigner employee based outside of Singapore to register for a Corppass Admin account. However, not all e-services are made available to Foreign ID Corppass users.

**How to apply:** <br>For ease and convenience, many foreign companies choose to engage the help of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.edb.gov.sg/connections-concierge/service-providers.html?tab=general-service-providers&amp;servicecategory=incorporation&amp;corporatesecretarialsolutions">corporate secretarial services</a> to manage the registration and setting up of a Corppass account, amongst other administrative matters. 
<br><br>Alternatively, you may find out more about Corppass and registration <a target="_blank" href="https://www.corppass.gov.sg/cpauth/login/homepage">here</a>.
