### 2 things to take note of before you apply
#### 1. Understand and prepare for the application process

##### For Employment Pass and S Pass&nbsp;

Employers will have to apply Employment Pass &amp; S Pass on their employeesâ€™ behalf on the Ministry of Manpower website on an eService known as [myMOM Portal](https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/mymom-portal).&nbsp;

To access myMOM Portal, employers will need a Corppass account and allow access of myMOMPortal to the company representative performing the application. [Corppass](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/) is an authorisation system for businesses to manage access of employees who need to perform corporate transactions on Singapore government digital services. Learn how to register for a Corppass account [here](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/corppass/common/findoutmore).&nbsp;
<br>
<br>

##### For all other passes (ONE Pass, Personalised Employment Pass, EntrePass and Tech.Pass)&nbsp;&nbsp;

Unlike Employment Pass or S Pass, individuals seeking to relocate to Singapore via ONE Pass, Personalised Employment Pass, EntrePass or Tech.Pass can apply for these passes directly via the application system for the respective passes.

#### 2. Take note of the Fair Consideration Framework&nbsp;&nbsp;

The [Fair Consideration Framework (FCF)](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/fair-consideration-framework) sets out requirements for all employers in Singapore to consider the workforce in Singapore fairly for job opportunities. Employers should not discriminate on characteristics that are not related to the job, such as age, gender, nationality or race.&nbsp;

To promote fair employment practices and improve labour market transparency, employers submitting Employment Pass and S Pass applications must first advertise on [MyCareersFuture](https://www.mycareersfuture.gov.sg/) and fairly consider all candidates.&nbsp;

Find out more about the FCF job advertising requirements for [Employment Pass](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/employment-pass/consider-all-candidates-fairly) and [S Pass](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/s-pass/consider-all-candidates-fairly).&nbsp;

However, for practical reasons, your company may not be required to advertise roles on MyCareersFuture if you meet any of the following requirements:&nbsp;

*   Your company has fewer than 10 employees.&nbsp;
    
*   The fixed monthly salary for the vacancy is $20,000 and above. (Note: From 1 Sep 2023, the salary threshold for exemption from FCF job advertising requirement will be raised to $22,500. This is benchmarked to the top 10% of EP holders.)&nbsp;
    
*   The role is short-term, i.e. not more than 1 month.&nbsp;
    
*   The role is to be filled by a local transferee.&nbsp;
    

*   \[for EP only\] The role is to be filled by a candidate choosing to apply as an [overseas intra-corporate transferee](https://www.mom.gov.sg/faq/fair-consideration-framework/can-a-job-be-exempted-from-the-advertising-requirement-if-it-will-be-filled-by-an-intra-corporate-transferee-ict).&nbsp;

To access a larger pool of candidates, employers in Singapore are strongly encouraged to advertise their job vacancies on MyCareersFuture, even if those jobs are eligible for advertising exemption.
