### Things to take note of before you apply
##### Understand and prepare for the application process
<br>
###### For Employment Pass and S Pass&nbsp;

Employers will have to apply Employment Pass &amp; S Pass on their employeesâ€™ behalf on the Ministry of Manpower website on an eService known as [myMOM Portal](https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/mymom-portal).&nbsp;

To access myMOM Portal, employers will need a Corppass account and allow access of myMOMPortal to the company representative performing the application. [Corppass](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/) is an authorisation system for businesses to manage access of employees who need to perform corporate transactions on Singapore government digital services. Learn how to register for a Corppass account [here](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/corppass/common/findoutmore).&nbsp;
<br>
<br>

###### For all other passes (ONE Pass, Personalised Employment Pass, EntrePass and Tech.Pass)&nbsp;&nbsp;

Unlike Employment Pass or S Pass, individuals seeking to relocate to Singapore via ONE Pass, Personalised Employment Pass, EntrePass or Tech.Pass can apply for these passes directly via the application system for the respective passes.
