## Familiarise yourself with Singapore’s employment laws

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/employment-act">The Employment Act</a> is Singapore’s main labour law. It outlines the basic terms and working conditions for all types of employees. It includes guidelines on paid public holiday &amp; leave entitlements for employees, and process requirements for employers.

Foreign employees holding a work pass are also covered by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/legislation/employment-of-foreign-manpower-act">Employment of Foreign Manpower Act</a>, which outlines an employer’s responsibilities and obligations for employing foreigners.

## Read guidelines for fair employment and consideration


Employers should take note of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/fair-consideration-framework">Fair Consideration Framework</a>, which sets out requirements for all employers to consider the workforce in Singapore fairly for job opportunities.

Employers are also expected to adhere to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tal.sg/tafep/resources/publications/2019/tripartite-guidelines-on-fair-employment-practices">Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices</a>, which set out fair employment practices that should be adopted by employers.
