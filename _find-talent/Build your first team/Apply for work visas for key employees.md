## Work visas

All foreigners who intend to work in Singapore must have a valid work pass (commonly known as a work visa) before they start work.

* If you are an employer, you may apply for the [Employment Pass and S Pass](#employment-pass-and-s-pass) for your foreign employees.
* If you are a working professional or entrepreneur, you may apply for a relevant [](##)[personalised work pass](#personalised-work-pass).  

## Employment Pass and S Pass
The Employment Pass (EP) and S Pass allows foreign professionals, managers, executives and skilled workers to work in Singapore. An employer must apply for the EP or S Pass on behalf of the candidate. 

This table provides an overview of the EP and S Pass:
