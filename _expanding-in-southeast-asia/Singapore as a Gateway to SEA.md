# Gateway to Southeast Asia  
# 
Business opportunities in Southeast Asia have increased dramatically, with the region boasting remarkable growth in the past decade and attracting record investments from around the world.

Singapore’s strategic location – we are within a six-hour radius of any Southeast Asian country – means that we are an ideal hub from which you can access the region and its growing consumer market.

Our strong historical and trade connections to the region also put your business on the fast track to understanding the nuances of operating in different parts of Southeast Asia.
