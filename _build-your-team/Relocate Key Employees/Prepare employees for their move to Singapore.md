However, we do not endorse or promote any content in particular, and kindly ask you to exercise discretion when referring to these resources._

### Find Housing in Singapore

Most expatriates would consider renting when first relocating to Singapore. You may wish to explore property portals such as [PropertyGuru](https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/) or [99.co](https://www.99.co/) for rental options across different areas in Singapore.

You can also consider co-living or serviced residences, which may provide greater flexibility as they offer shorter lease periods. Dollars and Sense, a local personal finance website, [offers a comprehensive guide to co-living and serviced residences in Singapore](https://dollarsandsense.sg/price-guide-co-living-spaces-serviced-apartments/).

For more comprehensive information, read this [guide to Settling in Singapore](https://singaporeglobalnetwork.gov.sg/guides/settling-in-sg/) by the Singapore Global Network which covers many other aspects of living and working in Singapore, beyond housing.
