### Find housing in Singapore

Most expatriates would consider renting when first relocating to Singapore. You may wish to explore property portals such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/">PropertyGuru</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.99.co/">99.co</a> for rental options across different areas in Singapore.

You can also consider co-living or serviced residences, which may provide greater flexibility as they offer shorter lease periods. Dollars and Sense, a local personal finance website, <a target="_blank" href="https://dollarsandsense.sg/price-guide-co-living-spaces-serviced-apartments/">offers a comprehensive guide to co-living and serviced residences in Singapore</a>.
