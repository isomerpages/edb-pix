## Tech@SG

Fast-growing companies can tap on the Tech@SG programme  to access the critical talent they need to grow and scale their business in Singapore and the region.

For eligible companies, the Tech@SG Programme provides **company-level endorsement to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)**, reducing the risks of rejections for their Employment Pass (EP) applications to MOM.

If your company is eligible, you can expect to receive:

* Up to 10 new EPs over two years for foreign employees who will be hired as part of your companyâ€™s core team in Singapore; and thereafter,

* Coverage for the first renewal of each new EP obtained under the programme (each renewal will be valid for up to three years)
